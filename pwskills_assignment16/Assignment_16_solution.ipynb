    "#### Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL databases) are different from traditional relational databases in that they store their data in a non-tabular form. Instead, non-relational databases might be based on data structures like documents. A document can be highly detailed while containing a range of different types of information in different formats. This ability to digest and organize various types of information side by side makes non-relational databases much more flexible than relational databases."

    "#### Today’s applications collect and store increasingly vast quantities of ever more complex customer and user data. The benefits of this data to businesses, of course, lie in their potential for analysis. Using a non-relational database can unlock patterns and value even within masses of variegated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several advantages to using non-relational databases, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Massive dataset organization:\n",
    "In the age of Big Data, non-relational databases can not only store massive quantities of information, but they can also query these datasets with ease. Scale and speed are crucial advantages of non-relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Flexible database expansion:\n",
    "Data is not static. As more information is collected, a non-relational database can absorb these new data points, enriching the existing database with new levels of granular value even if they don’t fit the data types of previously existing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Multiple data structures:\n",
    "The data now collected from users takes on myriad forms, from numbers and strings, to photo and video content, to message histories. A database needs the ability to store these various information formats, understand relationships between them, and perform detailed queries. No matter what format your information is in, non-relational databases can collate different information types together in the same document.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Built for the cloud:\n",
    "A non-relational database can be massive. And as they can, in some cases, grow exponentially, they need a hosting environment that can grow and expand with them. The cloud’s inherent scalability makes it an ideal home for non-relational databases."

    "> Schema-less Database: It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema-less database means one collection can hold different types of documents in it. Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold multiple documents and these documents may consist of the different numbers of fields, content, and size. It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational databases. Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Document Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these documents, the data is stored in fields(key-value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Indexing: In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the data is not indexed, then database search each document with the specified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, and these data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. It will also add new machines to a running database.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Replication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, it creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved from another server.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. It is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map-reduce function, and single-purpose aggregation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "> High Performance: The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc."
