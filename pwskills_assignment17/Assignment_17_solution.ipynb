    "In machine learning, overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying patterns, which leads to poor generalization on unseen data. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function that encourages the model to have smaller parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, two commonly used regularization techniques are L1 regularization and L2 regularization.\n",

    "L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term that is proportional to the absolute value of the parameters. The cost function with L1 regularization is given by:\n",

    "Both L1 and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting by making the model less complex and reducing the variance of the parameter estimates. The regularization parameter λ controls the trade-off between the fit to the training data and the complexity of the model. A larger value of λ results in a simpler model with smaller parameter values, while a smaller value of λ allows the model to fit the training data more closely, but may lead to overfitting. The optimal value of λ can be found using cross-validation or other model selection techniques."

    "Multicollinearity: This occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult for the model to distinguish their individual effects on the outcome variable. To address this, one can use techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the original variables into a set of uncorrelated components or use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to shrink the coefficients of the correlated variables.\n",

    "Non-linearity: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the outcome variable. However, in some cases, the relationship may be non-linear, leading to poor model performance. To address this, one can use techniques such as polynomial regression or spline regression to capture the non-linear relationships.\n",

    "Missing data: Logistic regression requires complete data for all the variables. However, in real-world datasets, missing data may be present, leading to biased or inaccurate results. To address this, one can use techniques such as imputation to fill in the missing values or use algorithms that can handle missing data, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).\n",

    "Outliers: Outliers are extreme values that may have a disproportionate effect on the logistic regression model.

    "Small sample size: Logistic regression requires a large enough sample size to estimate the model parameters accurately. If the sample size is small, the model may be unstable or overfit to the data. To address this, one can use techniques such as cross-validation or resampling to estimate the model's performance and avoid overfitting.\n",

To address this, one can use techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or cost-sensitive learning to balance the classes or use algorithms that can handle class imbalance, such as weighted logistic regression."
