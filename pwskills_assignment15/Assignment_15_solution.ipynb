    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines Lasso and Ridge regression techniques to address the limitations of each method. It is commonly used when there are multiple highly correlated predictor variables in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the objective function includes both L1 and L2 regularization terms, which control the amount of shrinkage applied to the regression coefficients. The L1 regularization term in Elastic Net Regression is similar to that of Lasso regression, which encourages sparsity by setting some of the coefficients to zero. The L2 regularization term in Elastic Net Regression is similar to that of Ridge regression, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not necessarily set them to zero."

    "Grid Search: In this method, a range of alpha and lambda values are specified, and the model is trained and validated for each combination of values. The optimal values of alpha and lambda are then chosen based on the validation error or another metric such as R-squared or mean squared error. This method can be computationally expensive, but it ensures that the optimal values are chosen from a wide range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search: This method is similar to grid search but randomly selects combinations of alpha and lambda values to train and validate the model. This can be faster than grid search, but there is a risk of missing the optimal values if the range of values is not broad enough.\n",

    "Cross-Validation: In this method, the data is split into training and validation sets, and the model is trained and validated for each combination of alpha and lambda values. The optimal values of alpha and lambda are chosen based on the validation error or another metric such as R-squared or mean squared error. This method can be computationally expensive, but it ensures that the optimal values are chosen for the specific dataset.\n",

    "Bayesian Optimization: This method uses a probabilistic model to predict the performance of the model for different combinations of alpha and lambda values. The model is then trained on the most promising combinations of alpha and lambda values, and the process is repeated until the optimal values are found. This method can be faster than grid search and cross-validation, but it requires domain knowledge to define the prior distribution and can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters."

    "\n",
    "Non-zero coefficients: If a coefficient is non-zero, it means that the corresponding predictor variable has a non-zero effect on the response variable. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the effect. A positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship between the predictor and response variables, while a negative coefficient indicates a negative relationship.\n",

    "Zero coefficients: If a coefficient is zero, it means that the corresponding predictor variable has no effect on the response variable. This can be useful for feature selection, as it allows you to identify the most important variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of regularization parameters: The values of the L1 and L2 regularization parameters (alpha and lambda) determine the trade-off between sparsity and accuracy in the model. A higher value of alpha will result in more coefficients being set to zero, while a higher value of lambda will result in smaller coefficient magnitudes. Therefore, the values of these parameters can impact the interpretation of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction effects: In Elastic Net Regression, the coefficients can also capture interaction effects between predictor variables. This means that the effect of one variable on the response variable can depend on the value of another variable. These interaction effects can be difficult to interpret, but can provide valuable insights into the relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable."
