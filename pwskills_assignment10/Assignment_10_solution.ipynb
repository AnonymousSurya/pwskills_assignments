    "#### Opening a file refers to getting the file ready either for reading or for writing. This can be done using the open() function. This function returns a file object and takes two arguments, one that accepts the file name and another that accepts the mode(Access Mode). Now, the question arises what is the access mode? Access modes govern the type of operations possible in the opened file. It refers to how the file will be used once it’s opened. These modes also define the location of the File Handle in the file. File handle is like a cursor, which defines from where the data has to be read or written in the file. There are 6 access modes in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Read Only (‘r’): Open text file for reading. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, raises an I/O error. This is also the default mode in which the file is opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Read and Write (‘r+’): Open the file for reading and writing. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Raises I/O error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write Only (‘w’): Open the file for writing. For the existing files, the data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write and Read (‘w+’): Open the file for reading and writing. For existing files, data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file.\n",
